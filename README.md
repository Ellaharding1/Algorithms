The Java code comprises two packages, LE6Q1 and LE6Q2, each encapsulating multiple classes. In LE6Q1, the EllasTestingSortingMethods class stands out, housing various sorting algorithms like Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Bucket Sort. These algorithms are designed as static methods, taking generic arrays and returning their sorting times. The mainMethod class orchestrates the execution and evaluation of these sorting algorithms, generating random integer arrays, applying the sorting methods, and displaying their execution times. On the other hand, LE6Q2 delves into sorting student data. The Ella_SortNameAndGrade class oversees the sorting of student names and grades. It initializes arrays of first names, last names, and grades, then creates corresponding StudentGrade objects. These objects are sorted based on grades using the Collections.sort method and by names using a custom insertion sort method. Finally, the sorted student lists are displayed. The StudentGrade class defines the structure of a student, including first name, last name, and grade, and implements the Comparable interface to enable sorting based on grades. Additionally, it provides methods to access and modify student attributes and formats the student's information for display. Overall, these classes focus on implementing and comparing various sorting algorithms as well as sorting student data based on different criteria.
